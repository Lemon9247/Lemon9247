  Hi, I'm Willow!

Currently working @ STFC for UKRI. I mainly work in computational materials science (DFT, Monte Carlo etc.). I also enjoy tinkering with servers, playing tabletop games, and making things.

Most of the stuff here is pet projects, work stuff can be found elsewhere. Feel free to take a look if you're interested!
