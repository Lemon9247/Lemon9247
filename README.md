  Hi, I'm Willow!
</h2>
Currently working @ STFC for UKRI. I mainly work in computational materials science, with a happy interest in AI agents. I also enjoy tinkering with servers, playing tabletop games, and making things.

Most of the stuff here is pet projects, not work-related. Feel free to take a look if you're interested!
