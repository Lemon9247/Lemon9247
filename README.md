If you don't know me already, I'm a Theoretical & Computational Physicist in the UK. I mainly work in computational materials science (DFT, Monte Carlo etc.). I also enjoy tinkering with servers, playing tabletop games, and making things.

Most of the stuff here is pet projects, work stuff can be found elsewhere. Feel free to take a look if you're interested!
