  Your Friendly Neighbourhood Theoretical Physicist

Welcome to my *personal* GitHub page! If you don't know me already, I'm a Theoretical Physicist ^-^ I'm currently doing my Master's degree with a heavy focus on gravitational quadrupoles. Without going into too much detail, those are the dominant source of gravitational waves and so they're quite important. My other interests can be summarised as galactic astrophysics and fundamental particle cosmology :>

Most of the stuff here is either work from my degree or pet projects. Feel free to take a look if you're interested! I won't claim to be a pro at all, but I enjoy learning.
